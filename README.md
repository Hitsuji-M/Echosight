# Echosight project

A video game based on a dark universe where only sound can help you travel in obscutiry

### How to play it
You can just download the release [here](https://github.com/Hitsuji-M/Echosight/tree/release). <br>
Keep in mind that it was our first time doing a Unity game and it's a student projet ^^

### What is it ?
Echosight is a project made with Unity and C# as a final project for my first year in our engineer degree. <br>
This is just a POC (Equivalent to the tutorial) to show how the game works. Everything has been made so we can extend the game with more levels and more detailed story.

### I Want To Play A Game.

*You are waking up...* <br>

You discover that everything is dark, no it's not the environement, it's you... You are completely blind... <br> but... <br> but... <br>

You hear the deepest sounds possible, you can hear them clearly and now you remember. You agreed to participate as a subject to a experience which is aiming to enhance human's senses by deleting others. Your hearing is more powerful than ever, (but calm down you are not daredevil your fighting skills are lower than a 10 year old boy). <br>

Joke aside, now, it's time for the tests, the scientifics are ready to play with you and **discover what you are capable of** !
